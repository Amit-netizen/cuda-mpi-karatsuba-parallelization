# cuda-mpi-karatsuba-parallelization
This project optimizes the Karatsuba algorithm for large integer multiplication using CUDA and MPI. By parallelizing computations on NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA, we achieved a 32.32× speedup (from 20.79ms to 0.691ms). With MPI, we achieved a 5.02× speedup (from 26.333ms to 5.241ms) for distributed execution on multi-core CPU clusters.
