# cuda-mpi-karatsuba-parallelization
This project optimizes the Karatsuba algorithm for large integer multiplication using CUDA and MPI. By parallelizing computations on NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA, we achieved a 32.32√ó speedup (from 20.79ms to 0.691ms). With MPI, we achieved a 5.02√ó speedup (from 26.333ms to 5.241ms) for distributed execution on multi-core CPU clusters.


üöÄ High-Performance Parallel Karatsuba Multiplication
This repository implements the Karatsuba algorithm for large integer multiplication, with optimizations using CUDA for GPU parallelism and MPI for distributed parallelism. The project demonstrates significant performance improvements by parallelizing the recursive multiplication steps, achieving speedups in both sequential and parallel executions.
